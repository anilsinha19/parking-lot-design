 This is a solution to automate parking ticket system to a multi-storey parking lot. The parking lot  can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one. It allows  customers to use  parking lot without human intervention.

parking_lot is the home directory.
Run ./bin/setup
This will build the project and creates an executable jar parking-lot.jar in the target folder. This is a java project build using maven. Please ensure maven is setup before running build.

# How to Run
parking_lot is the home directory.
